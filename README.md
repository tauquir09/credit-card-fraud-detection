# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A supervised machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Dataset
Dataset used: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run the `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb` notebook.

## Output
